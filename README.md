# NightShift

A Mithril.js component library inspired by the dense, utilitarian interfaces of mid-2000s DAWs and 3D modelling tools.

I've always had a soft spot for the gray, cramped, skeuomorphic aesthetic of 'pro' apps from that era - before the web became obsessed with whitespace and smooth transitions. NightShift revives that look for the kind of UI you'll be staring at late into the night.

Not production-ready - just inspiration for dashboards I'd like to build.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Opens at http://localhost:3000

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Output goes to `dist/`.

## Format

```bash
npm run format
```

## Notes

### I like...

- Slightly skeumorphic design of the buttons/selects with the subtle shadow and highilight - makes them look and feel interactive, precise.
- Compact whitespace / padding / margins - makes it possible to cram in a lot.
- Definitily not material inspired - material is getting a little tired!
- The instant tooltips that pop up above icon-only buttons telling you what they do - as a replacement for the missing label.

### What needs improvement

- Need to formalize the menu component.
